## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### Wallet Not Connecting

If your wallet isn't connecting:
1. Refresh the page and try again
2. Make sure your wallet is unlocked
3. Check if you have any pending wallet notifications
4. Verify that you're using a supported browser and wallet version

### Network Issues

If you're experiencing network-related problems:
1. Ensure you're on a supported network
2. Check if the network is congested or experiencing issues
3. Verify your wallet has sufficient funds for gas fees

### Browser Permissions

Some browsers may block wallet connections:
1. Check for blocked popups
2. Ensure site permissions allow for wallet connections
3. Disable any browser extensions that might interfere with Web3 connections

## Security Best Practices

When connecting your wallet to SyncDex or any dApp:

1. **Always verify the URL** - Make sure you're on `app.syncdex.finance` and not a phishing site
2. **Review permissions** - Only approve connections that request necessary permissions
3. **Use hardware wallets** for large transactions - Hardware wallets provide additional security
4. **Create a dedicated trading wallet** - Consider using a separate wallet with limited funds for trading
5. **Regularly check connected sites** - Periodically review and revoke access to sites you no longer use

Never share your wallet's recovery phrase or private keys with anyone, including SyncDex support. Legitimate support will never ask for this information.
