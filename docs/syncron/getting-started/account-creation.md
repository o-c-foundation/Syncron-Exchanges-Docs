# Creating Your Syncron Account

This guide walks you through the process of creating and setting up your account on Syncron, our advanced centralized exchange platform.

## Registration Process

Follow these steps to create your Syncron account:

1. **Visit the Syncron Website**: Navigate to [www.syncron.finance](https://www.syncron.finance)
2. **Click "Sign Up"**: Located in the top-right corner of the homepage
3. **Enter Your Information**:
   - Email address (must be valid for verification)
   - Strong password (minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols)
   - Country of residence
4. **Accept Terms**: Review and accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
5. **Complete reCAPTCHA**: Verify you're human by completing the reCAPTCHA challenge
6. **Email Verification**: Check your inbox for the verification email and click the confirmation link
   - If you don't see the email, check your spam folder or request a new verification email

## Account Security Setup

After email verification, you'll be prompted to set up essential security features:

### Password Best Practices

- Use a unique password not used on other websites
- Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords
- Change your password regularly (recommended every 3-6 months)

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Setting up 2FA is **strongly recommended** and required for certain account activities:

1. From your dashboard, navigate to "Security Settings"
2. Select "Enable 2FA"
3. Choose your preferred method:
   - **Authenticator App** (recommended): Scan the QR code with Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy
   - **SMS Authentication**: Receive codes via text message (less secure than authenticator apps)
4. Enter the verification code to confirm setup
5. Save the backup codes in a secure location
