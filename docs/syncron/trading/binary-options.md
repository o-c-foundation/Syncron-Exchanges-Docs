# Binary Options Trading

Syncron's innovative binary options trading system offers a sophisticated yet accessible approach to speculative trading with predetermined risk and reward profiles.

## What Are Binary Options?

Binary options are financial instruments that provide a fixed payout if the option expires "in-the-money" (prediction is correct) or result in loss of the investment if it expires "out-of-the-money" (prediction is incorrect).

Key characteristics:
- **Fixed Payout**: Predetermined return (typically 70-95%)
- **Known Risk**: Maximum potential loss is limited to your initial investment
- **Short Duration**: Expiry times ranging from 30 seconds to 24 hours
- **Directional Simplicity**: Predict if an asset's price will rise or fall
- **Settlement**: Cash-settled with no physical delivery of assets
