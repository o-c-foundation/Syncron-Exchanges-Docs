# Advanced Trading Tools

Syncron provides professional traders with sophisticated tools for enhanced market analysis, execution, and risk management. This guide covers our advanced trading features.

## Technical Analysis Suite

### Custom Indicators

Beyond standard technical indicators, Syncron offers proprietary analytical tools:

- **Liquidity Heatmap**: Visualize order book liquidity across price levels
- **Volume Profile**: Analyze traded volume at different price levels
- **Sync Sentiment Indicator**: Proprietary algorithm tracking market sentiment
- **Multi-timeframe Analysis**: View indicators across multiple timeframes simultaneously
- **Correlation Matrix**: Track relationships between multiple assets

### Indicator Builder

Create custom indicators with our visual programming interface:

1. Access the Indicator Builder from the chart settings
2. Choose from mathematical functions, existing indicators, and price data
3. Connect components visually or write custom scripts
4. Backtest your indicator against historical data
5. Save and share your creations with the community

```javascript
// Example custom indicator: Bollinger Bands with Volume Filter
function customBollingerVolume(length, stdDev, volThreshold) {
  const prices = close;
  const sma = SMA(prices, length);
  const sd = StdDev(prices, length);
  const upper = sma.plus(sd.multiply(stdDev));
  const lower = sma.minus(sd.multiply(stdDev));
  const volFilter = volume > SMA(volume, length) * volThreshold;
  
  return {
    upper: upper,
    middle: sma,
    lower: lower,
    signal: close < lower && volFilter ? "BUY" : close > upper && volFilter ? "SELL" : "NEUTRAL"
  };
}
```

## Advanced Order Types

### Algorithmic Orders

Syncron offers sophisticated order execution algorithms:

| Order Type | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| TWAP | Time-Weighted Average Price | Execute large orders over time to minimize market impact |
| VWAP | Volume-Weighted Average Price | Execute based on historical volume profile |
| Iceberg | Shows only a small portion of the total order | Hide large orders from the market |
| Trailing Stop | Adjusts stop price as market moves | Lock in profits during volatile trends |
| OCO | One-Cancels-Other | Place stop-loss and take-profit simultaneously |
| Scaled | Automatically spreads orders across price range | Accumulate or distribute positions |

### Conditional Orders

Create complex order logic using multiple conditions:

- **Price Triggers**: Based on specific price levels
- **Technical Indicator Signals**: Enter when indicators cross
- **Time-based Execution**: Schedule orders for specific times
- **Volume Conditions**: Execute based on volume thresholds
- **Chain Orders**: Create sequences of conditional orders

Example conditional setup:
```
IF (MACD crosses above Signal) AND (RSI < 70) AND (Daily volume > 5-day average)
THEN Place limit buy order at current price + 0.5%
```

Execute complex trading strategies via our API:

  init: async (api) => {
    // Subscribe to market data
    await api.subscribe('BTCUSDT', '1m');
  },
  
  onCandle: async (api, candle) => {
    const symbol = 'BTCUSDT';
    const bbands = await api.indicator('BBANDS', {
      symbol,
      interval: '1m',
      length: 20,
      stdDev: 2
    });
    
    const price = candle.close;
    
    // Buy if price touches lower band
    if (price <= bbands.lower) {
      await api.createOrder({
        symbol,
        side: 'BUY',
        type: 'LIMIT',
        quantity: calculatePosition(api.accountInfo(), price),
        price: price,
        timeInForce: 'GTC'
      });
    }
    
    // Sell if price touches upper band
    if (price >= bbands.upper) {
      await api.createOrder({
        symbol,
        side: 'SELL',
        type: 'LIMIT',
        quantity: calculatePosition(api.accountInfo(), price),
